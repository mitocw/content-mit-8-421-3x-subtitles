I want to talk about basic aspects of atom light
interaction.
And what I want to talk today about it
is the two important cases when an atom interacts
with monochromatic wave, or when it interacts
with a broad spectrum.
In one case, when I say monochromatic case,
you may just think of the best laser money can buy,
very, very sharp, very, very monochromatic.
When I talk about the broad spectrum,
you may just think about black-body spectrum
which is an isopod spectrum.
And they're two very different cases.
And some of it is just related to Nancy's question,
that if you have a broad spectrum,
we're always talking about many, many modes,
and they will be coherent, and there
will be irreversible physics.
Whereas for monochromatic light, everything
is a pure plane wave, and everything is coherent.
So we want to sort off, talk about that first,
and then later this week, I think on Wednesday,
we will talk about spontaneous emission.
But right now, we focus on the simpler case,
where we drive this system with electromagnetic radiation,
which is either narrow band or broadband.
But let's just start with a cartoon.
We have an atom, and for that discussion, all we need
is two levels, and all we need is
that the two levels are connected by some matrix
element.
And the basic phenomenal logic of the situation
is that we have one atom, which sits in a vacuum.

So we have volume v of vacuum.
And what is important now, is that walls,
or there imaginary boundary of what defines our vacuum,
is at low temperature.
And low temperature means that the atom
will irreversibly decay into the ground state with a lifetime
tau.

And that means that, in some picture,
the excited state has a broadening, which
is broadened by the natural lifetime,
and in our discussion, we assume,
and this is what I said with the cold walls of the vacuum,
that the energy difference is much, much larger
than the relevant temperature.
And this is very well for a field
for our standard atomic system.
The typical excitation energy, even
for atoms with a loosely bound electron Sc alkalize,
is to electron volt, which corresponds to a temperature
of 20,000 kelvin.
And even at the rather hot temperature, definitely
hot temperatures in the center for our anthropoid atoms,
but the key at room temperature corresponds
to 25 million electron volt.
So therefore, when we have an atom in isolation,
this is what we find.
We find an atom, which we irreversibly decay
to the ground state.
And the fact that it irreversibly
decays to the ground state is really
an inequality between energies.
If you would talk about the hyperfine transition,
or something, there may be a possibility
that we have an excited state, which is firmly excited.
But in the following discussion, when we drive the atom,
and when we look at spontaneous decay,
we always assume that the firmer energies are so small,
that we really assume an atom sitting in a cold vacuum.
Actually it's your next homework assignment,
where you will consider what are the effects
of the black-body radiation, and you will actually
find out in your homework that the unknown may be cheaper,
so yes, there are corrections, but you could also find out
that the corrections are rather small,
or it takes a long time before black-body radiation induces
any observable transition.

OK.
So I'm just trying to be a little bit, kind
of, formal here, give you, sort of,
a sketch in atom in a cold vacuum, ground state is stable,
excited state irreversibly decays.
And now we want to bring life into this situation.
Now we add light.

And the light, and this is now our discussion, has it been--
and we want to distinguish the cases of narrow band import
radiation.
So it's clear that if the bandwidth of the light,
the only scale-- well we have the scale of Omega,
but it's a huge scale-- the only smaller scale, which
is given by the atom, is signature of a line width,
and depending in which case we are,
we talk about narrow band excitation,
and broadband radiation.
And once the line reads is much narrower then gamma,
we can actually-- we don't get any new physics when we assume
perfectly monochromatic light.
So once we are much smaller, we are really
discussing the case of where we can neglect the spectra
cordoning of the light source, where in the other case, when
we have broadened light, we can pretty much make
the assumption that the light is infinitely need broad,
and what matters is only the spectral density of the light.
In a pictorial representation, if this is the frequency omega,
we have the atom with a natural line with gamma.
Narrow band means we are much sharper than that.

And broadband means we have a wide distribution.
So if you have broadband light, it doesn't really
matter what the total power is.
If the light is very broad, there
can be infinite power in the wings,
but the atoms don't care.
What matters when we have broadband radiation
is a quantity called the spectra density.
And it's what we need in the following, which is maybe just
give you the units, which is energy per volume and frequency
interval.
So we can talk about the spectral density as of omega,
or alternatively, we talk when we have a propagating beam,
we don't want to talk about energy.
We want to talk about intensity.
So it is intensity per unit frequency interval, which
would mean I of omega is the energy density multiplied
with the speed of light.
And that becomes energy per area and time.
So that's the flow of energy, but because we
are talking about broad light, it
has to be normalized by the frequency interval.
In contrast, monochromatic radiation,
it's sort of one monochromatic electric field.
And we will specify it by this inner frequency, omega,
and the electric field amplitude.

Which when multiply by a matrix element
becomes a Rabi frequency, or we can characterize the light
by the intensity I. But then it's
an intensity which has the units of energy per area time--
it's not normalized to any frequency interval,
because we have assumed that the frequency interval is zero.
If you now have a description of how these two forms of light
interact with the atom, at this point,
and we come to that later this week,
we have to make an assumption, that we
are looking at times, which are much smaller than the time
for spontaneous emission.
So if you know, in the probative sense,
expose the atoms to monochromatic, or broadband
radiation, unless we have included in the description
the many, many modes for spontaneous emission,
we are limiting ourselves to a very short time.
This is, you would say, a severe description,
because atoms emit photons after short time,
but we already capture without considering
spontaneous emission, a lot of different physics,
and we can nicely distinguish between features
of monochromatic, and features of broadband excitation.
OK.
So if you look at the two cases, in the monochromatic case,
we will discuss the idealized situation
of an atom interacting only with a single mode.
And what we will find out is, we will find out that now,
in the optical domain, you will find actually
equations for the two level system, which
are identical to what we discussed earlier,
when we discussed spin sensation in a magnetic field.
So in that sense, a two level system
driving by a laser system will behave identically
to a spin driven by a magnetic field.
It shouldn't come as a surprise, but I will show that to you,
but I can go over that very quickly.
The broadband case will actually follow from the single mode
case, because what we assume is broadband
means many, many single modes.
And then we do average over many single modes
by assuming random phase.
But I also want to show it to you,
because-- I pick my words carefully--
you have many, many modes, but we assume
that there's a random phase.
When we talked about 1:4:20, made it into an angle,
it maybe response to a question earlier,
this 4 maybe in a coherent superposition.
This is not many modes in a broadband way.
Many modes in a broadband way means
that there is no correlation whatsoever between the modes,
and all we will be able to talk about is an ion S
value of an electric field.
But anyway, the result is sort of predictable,
and I wanted to tell you what I'm aiming for.
But it's now really worthwhile to go through those exercises,
and look at what happens in equation v of b
four short times when we have monochromatic radiation
