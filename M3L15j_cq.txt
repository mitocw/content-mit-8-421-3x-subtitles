Two more, [? questions. ?] We talked a lot about the rotating
wave approximation.
And we also talked about it for spin system
driven by magnetic field.
If you have a rotating magnetic field,
we do not need the rotating wave approximation
because if you drive a spin system with a rotating
magnetic field, we have only the co-rotating term.
The question I have now for you is
whether the same is correct or not
for an electronic transition.
So therefore, the question is for electronic transitions,
do we always get the counter-rotating term?
And if you want to have a simple Hamiltonian,
then we do the rotating wave approximation.
So the question is, is the rotating wave approximation
necessary?
And because we always get the counter-rotating term
for the electronic transition, then the answer is yes.
Or are there examples where the system
is exactly described by only one term, the co-rotating term?
