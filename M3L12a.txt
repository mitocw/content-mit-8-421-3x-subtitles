We've talked about electric and magnetic field
separately for very good reasons because low-frequency fields
are either electric or magnetic in nature.
But ultimately, we're going to understand what happens
when atoms interact with light.
The outline of this chapter is as follows-- today,
all I want to discuss is the coupling matrix element.

In other words, when we have a Hamiltonian
between state a and b, we have an off-diagonal matrix element.
And this off-diagonal matrix element causes transitions.
Or when we calculate it, the effect
of an electric field, the DC Stark effect or the AC Stark
effect, we assume there was a quantity state 1, state 2.
And we put some operator in between.
So this was a matrix element which connects the two states.
And so far, we have always assumed,
using the classical multipole expansion
of electromagnetic field energy, that this matrix
element has the form electric field times dipole matrix
element.
And therefore, the relevant matrix element
was the position operator of the electron connecting the two
states.
So in a way, we have used it all the time.
But in any more advanced discussion of atomic physics,
you have two states.
And as long as they are coupled, you
have something which you call H12 or you call matrix element
M12.
And you're not even asking where it comes from.
When two levels are coupled, they undergo Rabi oscillations.
You have transitions.
If you're in the excited state and you're a matrix element,
you get spontaneous emission.
So a lot of the things we want to discuss
about atomic physics all will require
a number, which is a matrix element between state
1 and state 2.
And today, I want to talk to you about different mechanisms
which can lead to matrix elements.
We talked about the dipole operator,
but we also talked about higher order possibilities,
magnetic dipole coupling or electric quadrupole coupling.
And in little bit later-- this is
an outlook-- we talk about two-photon coupling.
But in the end, even if it's a two-photon coupling,
for a lot of phenomena, all you need
there is a coupling-- a coupling means a Rabi frequency.
A Rabi frequency means Rabi oscillation and so on.
So today, the focus is what is the structure, what
are the principles behind this number, which
is the relevant matrix element.

OK.
So that's today.
Next week is spring break.
But when we resume, we then want to talk about what
is the matrix element doing.
And there are two cases which we have to consider.
One is we can say it's narrowband and broadband.
This matrix element can couple just one mode
of the electromagnetic field.
Everything is coherent.
We have a coherent Rabi oscillation.
Or you can couple too many modes,
and then you have a broadband situation,
which may be described by Fermi's Golden rule as incoherent.
Very, very different behavior.
So that's what you then want to discuss.
When atoms interact with light, we
have two very different limiting cases--
narrowband and broadband.
And eventually, we want to go beyond
the semi-classical formulation of the electromagnetic field.
And we'll talk about the quantized electromagnetic
field.
