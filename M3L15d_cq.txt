Next question-- can spontaneous emission
be described as a stimulated emission process
by the zero point field?

So by the zero point field-- we know the electromagnetic wave
is a harmonic oscillator.
A harmonic oscillator is a ground state and [INAUDIBLE]
zero point motion.
So there is an electric field even when
we have the vacuum state.
And the question is can spontaneous emission
be described as simply being stimulated emission
but now due to the zero point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field?
