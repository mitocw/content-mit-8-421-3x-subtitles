OK.
We emphasized that spontaneous emission
is proportional to omega cubed.

The question is now what is the dependence in one dimension?
If everything the atom can only emit in one dimension.
Everything is one dimensional.
Put the atom into a waveguide.
So your choices are omega cubed, omega squared, or omega-- well,
a few pressed D, none of the above.
I can tell you.
It's one of those three.
So everything the same, but we are in one dimension.
The world seen by the atom and by the electromagnetic waves
is one dimensional.
