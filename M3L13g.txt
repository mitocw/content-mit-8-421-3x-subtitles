We can actually discuss the monochromatic case,
not just in perturbation theory, but we can do it exactly.
And this is what I want to do now.
Anyway, I want to do perturbation theory
of the broadband case.
And the broadband case will be an incoherent sum
over the single mode case.
So this is why I had to bore you want with,
what do we get out of perturbation theory
for the monochromatic case?
Of course, you know already that in a two-level system
we can do it exactly.
And I just want to outline it, mainly
to introduce some notation.
Our Hamiltonian here, which couples the ground and excited
state, is given by the dipole matrix element,
the electric field vector.
And we call this the Rabi frequency.
And then we have a sinusoidal or co-sinusoidal frequency
dependence.
And all I want to do is to show you
that a two-level system driven by an electromagnetic field
is identical to spin 1/2, which we discussed earlier.
And then, we are done.

There is sort of one technical or little trick we have to do,
which is trivial, but I want to mention it.
So if you want to compare directly with spin 1/2,
we are now shifting the ground state
to 1/2 the excitation frequency.
In other words, just to make the clear analogy with the spin,
usually we say, for an electronic transition,
we start at 0 and we go up.
But now we shift things that the 0 of energy
is in the middle between the ground and the excited state.
And then, it looks like the excited state
is spin up the counts.
It is spin down.
So with that, our Hamiltonian is now excited excited minus--
so all I've done is I've shifted the origin.

And the coupling, using our definition
off the Rabi frequency, couples ground and excited state
and excited ground state.
These are two off-diagonal matrix elements.
And the time dependence is cosine omega t.
So we are now very close to exploit the correspondence
with spin 1/2.
Because after shifting the ground state energy,
this is the z component of the spin
operator, the polar matrix.
And this here is the x component.
So therefore, for driving an electronic transition
with a laser beam, we have actually
spin Hamiltonian, which has the standard form.
So let me just write it down because it's
an important result. The Hamiltonian for driving
and dipole transition with a linearly polarized laser beam
corresponds, or is identical, to the Hamiltonian
for spin 1/2 in a static magnetic field
along the z direction, which causes the splitting
between spin up and spin down.
And this splitting is now omega eg
plus a linearly polarized oscillating
field along the x direction.

And you probably remember that when we discussed the spin
problem what we liked actually most
was that we had a rotating magnetic field because it
made everything simpler.
And we're doing that now by formally writing the linearly
polarized field as a superposition
of left-handed and right-handed or counter-rotating
and co-rotating magnetic field.
So let me just do that.
So we have the z part.
And now, instead of having just sigma x cosine omega t,
I add sigma y sine omega t.
And I subtract sigma y sine omega t.

So now, we have shown that there is something in addition
to the spin problem we had when we had a rotating
magnetic field, that we have two components here which rotate.
And these are the co- and counter-rotating magnetic
fields in the spin problem.
And the counter-rotating-- you remember, in the spin problem,
we solved the problem exactly by going
into a frame which rotated at the Larmor frequency,
which becomes now omega eg.
And the co-rotating term became stationary on resonance
in this rotating frame, whereas the counter-rotating term
rotates at a very high frequency in this frame at the Larmor
frequency.
So if this frequency-- if you fulfill the inequalities
that the co-rotating term is close to resonance,
or in other words, we are close to resonance,
and we're not using an infinite intensity of the laser beam
that we broaden everything in co- and counter-rotating
terms of [INAUDIBLE] resonance.
So if you fulfill those two conditions,
then we can neglect the last term.
And this is the rotating wave approximation.

So in other words, in the spin problem,
we can always assume we have a circularly polarized,
we have a rotating magnetic field,
and we have an exact solution.
I'll say a little bit more about it later.
But in many situations, when you excite an atom with a laser
beam, you get both terms.
And usually, you proceed by neglecting one term
and by making the rotating wave approximation.
I will, in one or two lectures, discuss
whether there are situations where the counter-rotating term
is exactly 0 due to angular momentum selection rules.
But that's a separate discussion.
In many situations, it cannot be avoided, and it's always there.
It's actually always there to the point
that when I talk to some colleague and he says,
I can create a situation in an atom
where the counter-rotating term is exactly 0.
Some colleagues reacted with disbelief
and then eventually felt that the situation
I created for angular momentum conservation
was somewhat artificial.
But we'll get there.
It's an interesting discussion.
But anyway, just remember that for magnetic drive, if you
use a rotating magnetic field, you don't need a rotating wave
approximation.
Everything rotates at one frequency.
But usually when you drive at two levels [INAUDIBLE]
with lasers, you usually have an extra term
which needs to be neglected.
OK.
But if you do the rotating wave approximation,
we have now exactly the situation
we discussed for spin 1/2 in a rotating magnetic field.
And then, the same equation have the same results.
And then, our results for spin 1/2
are now as expected-- Rabi oscillations
without making any assumptions about perturbation theory.
So this is an exact result for the initial conditions
that we start in the ground state.
And the initial population, the excited state, is 0.
And as usual, I have used here the generalized Rabi frequency,
which is a quadrature sum of these matrix elements
squared and the detuning.
