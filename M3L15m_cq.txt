The last question is about the Lamb shift.
We are now talking about electronic transitions,
and the question is-- is it due to the counter rotating term?
In other words, if you have a situation where the counter
rotating term is 0, as we just discussed
in the previous example that there may be situations,
somewhat artificial, but you could arrange for it.
That said, then imply that there is no Lamb shift.
Yes or no?
Is the Lamb shift caused by the counter rotating term involved
in electronic transitions?
